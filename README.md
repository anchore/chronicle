**A fast changelog generator that sources changes from GitHub PRs and issues, organized by labels.**


Create a changelog from the last GitHib release until the current git HEAD tag/commit for the git repo in the current directory:
```bash
chronicle 
```

Create a changelog with all changes from v0.16.0 until current git HEAD tag/commit for the git repo in the current directory:
```bash
chronicle --since-tag v0.16.0
```

Create a changelog between two specific tags for a repo at the given path
```bash
chronicle --since-tag v0.16.0 --until-tag v0.18.0 ./path/to/git/repo
```

Create a changelog and guess the release version from the set of changes in the changelog
```bash
chronicle --speculate-next-version
```

Just guess the next release version based on the set of changes (don't create a changelog)
```bash
chronicle next-version
```

## Installation

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/chronicle/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```

...or, you can specify a release version and destination directory for the installation:

```
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/chronicle/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b <DESTINATION_DIR> <RELEASE_VERSION>
```

## Configuration

Configuration search paths:
  - `.chronicle.yaml`
  - `.chronicle/config.yaml`
  - `~/.chronicle.yaml`
  - `<XDG_CONFIG_HOME>/chronicle/config.yaml`

  # list of definitions of what labels applied to issues or PRs constitute a changelog entry. These entries also dictate

  changes: [...<list of entries>...] # See "Default GitHub change definitions" section for more details

```

### Default GitHub change definitions

The `github.changes` configurable is a list of mappings, each that take the following fields:

- `name`: _[string]_ singular, lowercase, hyphen-separated (no spaces) name that best represents the change (e.g. "breaking-change", "security", "added-feature", "enhancement", "new-feature", etc).
- `title`: _[string]_ title of the section in the changelog listing all entries.
- `semver-field`: _[string]_ change entries will bump the respective semver field when guessing the next release version. Allowable values: `major`, `minor`, or `patch`.
- `labels`: _[list of strings]_ all issue or PR labels that should match this change section.

The default value for `github.changes` is:

```yaml
- name: security-fixes
  title: Security Fixes
  semver-field: patch
  labels:
    - security
    - vulnerability
  
- name: added-feature
  title: Added Features
  semver-field: minor
  labels:
    - enhancement
    - feature
    - minor
  
- name: bug-fix
  title: Bug Fixes
  semver-field: patch
  labels:
    - bug
    - fix
    - bug-fix
    - patch
  
- name: breaking-feature
  title: Breaking Changes
  semver-field: major
  labels:
    - breaking
    - backwards-incompatible
    - breaking-change
    - breaking-feature
    - major
    
- name: removed-feature
  title: Removed Features
  semver-field: major
  labels:
    - removed
  
- name: deprecated-feature
  title: Deprecated Features
  semver-field: minor
  labels:
    - deprecated
```

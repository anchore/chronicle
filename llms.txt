# Chronicle

Chronicle is a fast changelog generator that sources changes from GitHub PRs and issues, organized by labels. It's a Go-based CLI tool developed by Anchore that helps automate the creation of changelogs for software releases.

## Project Structure

This is a Go project with the main package located in `cmd/chronicle/`. The core functionality is in the `chronicle/` directory with the following key components:

- **Release management**: `chronicle/release/` contains logic for parsing changes, formatting output, and managing releases
- **GitHub integration**: `chronicle/release/releasers/github/` handles GitHub API interactions for PRs, issues, and releases
- **Git operations**: `internal/git/` provides Git repository operations
- **CLI interface**: `cmd/chronicle/cli/` contains the command-line interface and commands

## Key Features

- Generates changelogs from GitHub PRs and issues based on labels
- Supports multiple output formats (markdown, JSON)
- Can guess next semantic version based on change types
- Configurable via YAML files
- Supports custom label-to-changelog-section mappings
- Can work with GitHub Enterprise deployments

## Configuration

Chronicle uses `.chronicle.yaml` configuration files and supports various options for customizing changelog generation, GitHub integration, logging, and semantic versioning behavior.

## Usage

The tool can generate changelogs between git tags, guess next versions, and format output in different ways. It's designed to integrate into CI/CD pipelines for automated release management.
